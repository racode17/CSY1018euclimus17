Assignment1: Web Development
Submission Date: 8th April 2017

After series of hard work from week 1-12, I was finally able to create my website. Firstly to get some context about portfolios I googled some of the portfolios and gained some ideas. Then from the very first week I have been working on my webpages. I used to spend about 2-3 hours a day. It took me approximately 65 hours to complete the website. I wanted to make my navigation system’s menu items of same width which I couldn’t. Besides that my website is simple looking with easy navigations and responsive. While completing my website, I came across a number of difficulties. I went online and got some possible solutions to my problems and our module tutor from NAMI Mr. Ganesh Khatri also helped me to come over them.
